				<p>Spring Lake Elementary is uniquely composed of over 700 students representing 36 countries.  We are proud of the richness and distinctness of our community's many cultures and demographics! Our lives are so much richer and fuller when we appreciate and value other people, even those who are very different from us in culture or race.</p>
				<p>Spring Lake Elementary will continue to explore methods of revitalizing classroom instruction utilizing emerging technology and research. We have worked to build our technological resources while keeping in mind our ultimate goal to add technology to make classroom instruction more engaging to students. Some of our most engaging technology consists of class sets of palms, response clickers, laptop computers, and flip cameras for student presentations, just to name a few.</p>
				<p>Building 1 includes 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grades as well as a new media center, news studio, computer production lab, and our “manatee area” which consists of a new stage with a state of the art lighting and sound system for school performances. Our classrooms are all self contained and equipped with Bright Link projectors, interactive white boards, and Light Speed microphone sound systems to enhance instruction. Buildings 2 and 3 all have interactive white boards to enhance instruction.  Walking the hallways in the mornings is a calming experience with classical music playing softly while students await another exciting day at Spring Lake Elementary to begin.</p>
				<p>Spring Lake Elementary has adopted a new behavior incentive program called PBS. PBS stands for “Positive Behavior Support” and is a program for setting expectations and aligning those expectations with positive reinforcement to encourage positive behavior. The four expectations that all students will be learning about at Spring Lake are Be Safe, Be Respectful, Be Honest, and Be an Active Participant. Teachers will continuously model and teach what each of these expectations looks like within our school and students and classes will be recognized for following our expectations regularly. Our students will continue to practice Cooperative Learning strategies within the classroom to promote positive student interaction, enhance communication skills, and create a respectful climate that will encourage them to monitor their own behavior.</p>   
				<p>Spring Lake Elementary is a great place to be!  Our students are our number one priority and our staff is dedicated and hard working. We are looking forward to another amazing year. Go Manatees!</p>
