				<h1>School Background</h1>
				<p><img class='icon' src='images/school_icon.png' alt="School Icon">
				Spring Lake Elementary was established in 1966 and has served the 
				community with an outstanding education for many years. The school is located 
				in Altamonte Springs, Florida, which is about 15 miles outside of Orlando, 
				Florida. Spring Lake has been a Five Star School for the past 5 years. Our 
				Principal, Mr. Alex Agosto and Assistant Principal, Ms. Kimberly Lochrane are 
				committed to setting a standard of excellence. The current focus for Spring Lake 
				Elementary is the revitalization of classroom instruction utilizing current technology 
				and research to promote positive collaboration, enhance learning and create a respectful

				<h2>Our Technology</h2>
				<p><img class='icon' src='images/tech_icon.gif' alt="Technology Icon">
				Spring Lake Elementary is one of the leading elementary schools in technology 
				integration. Teachers and students use computers and technology as a part of their 
				daily curriculum. Each classroom has an average of three computers and the school 
				has three labs with 28 computers in each for student use and one mini lab with 15 
				computers. Our SuccessMaker Labs are used for a specific software program that allows 
				students in Grades 1-5  to practice math and reading skills aligned with the Next 
				Generation Sunshine State Standards for their grade level. The production lab is used by  
				teachers when they have a  special project they are working on incorporating  technology 
				such as: Webquests, Digital Storytelling, Podcasts, Blogs, Online Research, 
				Excel Spreadsheets, PowerPoint  projects, and virtual field trips.  In addition to desktop 
				computers, we have Tungsten E2 Hand-held computers, Epson BrightLinks, Promethean ActivBoard, 
				AlphaSmart NEOs, 4 wireless laptop computer labs and many other technological tools.</p>

			<h2>Awards &amp; Recognition</h2>
				<h3>Spring Lake Elementary is an A+ School</h3>
				<p>Spring Lake Elementary is now an A+ school! Schools are assigned a grade 
				each year by the Florida Department of Education. These grades are based 
				primarily upon student achievement data from the Florida Comprehensive 
				Assessment Test (FCAT). School grades communicate to the public how well 
				a school is performing relative to state standards. School grades are calculated 
				based on annual learning gains of each student toward achievement of Sunshine State 
				Standards, the progress of the lowest quartile of students, and the meeting of proficiency standards.</p>
				
				<h3>Dual Language Classes on the Rise in Central Florida</h3>
				<p>When it comes time for math and phonics at Spring Lake Elementary School, 
				first-graders in an experimental classroom stop speaking English and start 
				learning in a language that's foreign to many of them.</p>
				
				<h3>Spring Lake Elementary Awarded Five Star School Award</h3>
				<p>The Five Star School Award was created by the Commissioner's Community 
				Involvement Council and is presented annually to those schools that have shown 
				evidence of exemplary community involvement. In order to earn FIVE STAR school 
				recognition, a school must show documentation that it has achieved 100% of the 
				established criteria in the categories of:</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Business partnerships</li>
					<li>Family Involvement</li>
					<li>Volunteerism</li>
					<li>Student Community Service</li>
					<li>School Advisory Councils</li>
				</ol>
